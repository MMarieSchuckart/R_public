# R_public

This is just a conglomerate of old R-scripts I still return to sometimes to look stuff up.

In [this one](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/R_public/blob/main/Flanker_noise_stats), I'm analyzing data from a flanker task experiment from Madeleine Dering's Diploma study. I wrote this for a publication, so there's a pretty nice raincloud plot in there if you scroll to the end.

There's another one [here](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/R_public/blob/main/SIFI_Noise_preproc_stats) I wrote for the same publication on a dataset from Ida Zimmermann's Diploma study on the influence of noise on the perception of the SIFI. The first part of the script is by Julian Keil, the stats part and the plots are written by me. It's super long and I probably should have written several scripts & a pipeline, but you can scroll down a bit and have a look at the stats part if you want to know how to run all your tests in a loop instead of copying & pasting the same block of code 100x. Super useful if you have a lot of conditions! 

If you participated in my R Workshop from June 2021, [this file](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/R_public/blob/main/R_Tutorial_June2021) might be the one you're looking for. It walks you through a simple analysis of behavioral data from a lab.js study on the redundant signals effect (reading in data, preprocessing, stats & plotting). If you need the dataset we worked with, feel free to write me an email and I'll send it to you.
